## Final Project -- Genre-ator: a Movie Genre Classification and Captioning System

This is the code for the Final Project of the COMS W 4995: Deep Learning for Computer Vision course at Columbia University (https://www.deeplearningforcomputervision.com/home/deep-learning-for-computer-vision) in Fall '20. For this project, I collaborated with Jetasri Gupta.

I created a film poster genre classification and captioning system (the ‘Genre-ator’) that used CNNs for image classification to identify the genre of a movie from its poster and used LSTMs to caption the poster with elements in the image (such as “a standing man in black”).
